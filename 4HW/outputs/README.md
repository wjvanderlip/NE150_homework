# Solutions for 4

## Lady Godiva original code:
Keff = .9978

## 4a- 50 at% enrichment:
Keff = .7160

Criticality achieved at R= 12.68 cm
Keff = 1.003

## 4b- 50 at% and lead shield
Keff = .8601

Criticality achieved at R= 12.
Note=Lead shield kept at 10cm thickness
Keff = 1.003

# Solutions for 5

## k_inf
Since boundary conditions are reflective:
K_inf = K_eff =
